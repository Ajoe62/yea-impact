# Execution Plans (YEA Impact)

Use this file to write short, living plans for any meaningful change.
A good plan should let a new contributor complete the task with no other context.

## When to write a plan

- New user-facing features
- Data model changes (Supabase tables/policies)

- Anything that touches multiple files
